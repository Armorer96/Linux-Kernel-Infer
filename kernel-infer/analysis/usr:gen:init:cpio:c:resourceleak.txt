		fprintf(stderr, "ERROR: unable to open '%s': %s\n\n",
			filename, strerror(errno));
		usage(argv[0]);
		exit(1);

	while (fgets(line, LINE_SIZE, cpio_list)) {
		int type_idx;
		size_t slen = strlen(line);

In the reports file would be opened using fopen(filename, "r")) and would be read
line by line in while loop at 568 line. At line 623 with exit(ec) call all open streams
will be closed.
