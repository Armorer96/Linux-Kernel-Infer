Type: NULL_DEREFERENCE
Where: https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v4.20-rc3/source/drivers/dma-buf/seqno-fence.c#L42
Code:
static bool seqno_enable_signaling(struct dma_fence *fence)
{
	struct seqno_fence *seqno_fence = to_seqno_fence(fence);

	return seqno_fence->ops->enable_signaling(fence);
}
Commit ID: TODO
Category: Bug
Explanation: seqno_fence should have a null check before being dereferenced as
to_seqno_fence can return null.
Patch to kernel: In process
