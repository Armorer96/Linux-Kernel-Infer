Type: UNINITIALIZED_VALUE
Where: https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/lib/decompress_bunzip2.c#L271
Explanation: The value read from length[_] was never initialized.
Code:
`
/* Find largest and smallest lengths in this group */
minLen = maxLen = length[0];
for (i = 1; i < symCount; i++) {
`
Commit ID: TODO
Category: FP

In method get_next_block at line 195, there is
`symTotal = 0;`

In next lines of code symTotal value may increase at worst case it is assigned a value
of 0. At line 233, sysTotal will have a value of 2 max and value to t is assigned at
245. At line 271 in the reported code, symCount at least equal to 2. So in this case
it will assign values to length[0] and length[1].

Looking at the definition of get_bits.

`
static unsigned int INIT get_bits(struct bunzip_data *bd, char bits_wanted)
{
	unsigned int bits = 0;

	/* If we need to get more data from the byte buffer, do so.
	   (Loop getting one byte at a time to enforce endianness and avoid
	   unaligned access.) */
	while (bd->inbufBitCount < bits_wanted) {
		/* If we need to read more data from file into byte buffer, do
		   so */
		if (bd->inbufPos == bd->inbufCount) {
			if (bd->io_error)
				return 0;
			bd->inbufCount = bd->fill(bd->inbuf, BZIP2_IOBUF_SIZE);
			if (bd->inbufCount <= 0) {
				bd->io_error = RETVAL_UNEXPECTED_INPUT_EOF;
				return 0;
			}
			bd->inbufPos = 0;
		}
		/* Avoid 32-bit overflow (dump bit buffer to top of output) */
		if (bd->inbufBitCount >= 24) {
			bits = bd->inbufBits&((1 << bd->inbufBitCount)-1);
			bits_wanted -= bd->inbufBitCount;
			bits <<= bits_wanted;
			bd->inbufBitCount = 0;
		}
		/* Grab next 8 bits of input from buffer. */
		bd->inbufBits = (bd->inbufBits << 8)|bd->inbuf[bd->inbufPos++];
		bd->inbufBitCount += 8;
	}
	/* Calculate result */
	bd->inbufBitCount -= bits_wanted;
	bits |= (bd->inbufBits >> bd->inbufBitCount)&((1 << bits_wanted)-1);

	return bits;
}

`

This returns an unsigned int bits. I'm not able to find a part where the function
will return an unitialized value.
