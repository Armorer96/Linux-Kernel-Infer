Type: Memory Leak
Where: https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/lib/list_sort.c#L27
Explanation:  `tail->next` is not reachable after line 27, column 4.
Code:
`
	struct list_head head, *tail = &head;

	while (a && b) {
		/* if equal, take 'a' -- important for sort stability */
		if ((*cmp)(priv, a, b) <= 0) {
			tail->next = a;
			a = a->next;
		} else {
			tail->next = b;
			b = b->next;
		}
		tail = tail->next;
	}
	tail->next = a?:b;
	return head.next;
`
Category: I think Bug as a memory leak or could be just an optimization

tail->next's previous reference can't be referred anyway per Infer. So it suggests
to first free tail->next value and than assign it to a, or b.
