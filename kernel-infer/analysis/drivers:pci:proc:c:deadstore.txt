Where: https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v4.20-rc3/source/drivers/pci/proc.c#L100
Code:
if (cnt) {
	unsigned char val;
	pci_user_read_config_byte(dev, pos, &val);
	__put_user(val, buf);
	buf++;
	pos++;
	cnt--;
}
Commit ID: TODO
Category: Possibly a bug
Explanation: buf is not passed as pointer to pointer to memory address and be a bug
when the value update is not shown in the caller. It is better to pass this as pointer
to pointer address.
Patch to kernel: In process.
