Type: NULL_DEREFERENCE
Where: https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/tools/lib/subcmd/help.c#L18
Explanation: Pointer ent is assigned allocated memory using malloc and is dereferenced
immediately without null check.
Code:
struct cmdname *ent = malloc(sizeof(*ent) + len + 1);

	ent->len = len;
	memcpy(ent->name, name, len);
	ent->name[len] = 0;

Commit ID: TODO
Patch: In process
Category: Bug
Call to malloc can fail and can cause a segmentation error while dereferencing.
