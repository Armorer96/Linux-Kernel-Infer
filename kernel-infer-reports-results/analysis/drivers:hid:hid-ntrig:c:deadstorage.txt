Explanation: The value written to &ret (type int) is never used.
Code:
`
if (ret == 8) {
> 		ret = ntrig_version_string(&data[2], buf);
  		hid_info(hdev, "Firmware version: %s (%02x%02x %02x%02x)\n",

}
`
Commit ID: TODO
Category: Bug
After assigning ret at line 162, `ret = ntrig_version_string(&data[2], buf);` the value
is not used and it is a non static local variable. I think the value should not be
assigned.
Patch: In-Process
